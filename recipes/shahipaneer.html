        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Shahi Paneer is a popular North Indian royal dish made with soft cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) simmered in a creamy, aromatic, and mildly spiced gravy of tomatoes, onions, cashew nuts, and traditional Indian spices. The term "Shahi" means "royal," and this dish truly lives up to its name with its rich texture and luxurious flavor. Often garnished with cream and fresh coriander, Shahi Paneer is typically served with naan, roti, or jeera rice, making it a favorite in festive and special meals.</p>
